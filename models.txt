With the type of dataset we are working with, it makes most sense to stick with using regressors for predictions, in this case predicting the prices of houses with respect to their location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and whether or not they are furnished.

# Linear Regression -
The first model we started with was linear regression. It implements the Ordinary Least Squares procedure to make estimations by minimising the sum of the squares in the difference between the observed and predicted values of the data as a straight line.
This model proved to be useful but we also tried both Lasso and Ridge regression models which are both based off of linear regression but instead have regularisers to minminise the sum of the squared error of the model.

# Lasso Regression - 
Lasso (standing for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) performs L1 regularisation by adding the absolute value of magnitude of coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty is based of the hyperparameter C. As C shrinks towards 0, Lasso will start decreasing the coefficients of variables that aren't as useful sometimes down to 0. If C is set too small, it won't prioritise any value and set them all to zero, and conversely, if C is set too high then it will prioritise every value given to it and every value will have an affect on the model, so finding a good value for C is important.

# Ridge Regression - 
Ridge performs L2 regularisation on the linear model by by adding the square of the absolute value of magnitude of coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function. Instead of setting the less important values to 0 like Lasso does, Ridge instead puts weighting on these values, with a high value of C adding too much weighting which leads to underfitting.

# Selecting Hyperparameters
In order for Lasso and Ridge to work at their best, the best penalty value (alpha = 1 / 2C) needed to be found. To do this we used k-fold cross-validation to find out the value for C.

^^^^
Literally no clue if my k-fold cross-validations are correct they seem really not useful unless they're just meant to be like that idk if its due to the data or what???? someone please follow up
